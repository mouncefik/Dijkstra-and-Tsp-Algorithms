# City Graph Representation

This project provides a straightforward implementation of a graph structure that models cities and their interconnections. Key features include:

- **City Management**: Easily add new cities to the graph.
- **Connection Creation**: Establish connections between cities to represent direct routes.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Utilize Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently determine the shortest paths from a specified starting city to all other cities in the graph.
- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Implement an algorithm to find the optimal tour cost, ensuring the most efficient route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point.

This project serves as a foundational tool for understanding graph theory applications in urban planning, logistics, and route optimization.
